1. Project Overview 
This project focuses on developing a secure and reliable authentication module that integrates directly with modern operating systems. As cyber threats increase, traditional password-based authentication is no longer enough to protect sensitive system resources. To address this, the module introduces multifactor authentication (MFA) and strong security controls to ensure only authorized users can access the system. 
The authentication module enhances OS security by combining password verification, secure hashing, and one-time password (OTP/TOTP) based MFA. This layered approach significantly reduces risks from password leaks, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. The module also implements protection against common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, trapdoors, and unsafe memory operations by enforcing bounds checking, safe input handling, and compiler-level security features. 
To ensure compatibility and flexibility, the system integrates seamlessly with Linux environments through PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). This allows the module to work with existing login mechanisms, SSH authentication, sudo operations, and other system services without major modifications. 
In addition, the module includes a logging and monitoring component that records authentication events, failed login attempts, and suspicious activities. These logs help administrators detect abnormal behavior and strengthen overall system security.

3. Functionalities 
The Secure Authentication Module provides several essential functionalities designed to improve the security and reliability of the operating system’s authentication process. 
•	User Registration and Authentication 
The system allows secure registration of new users and verification of existing users during login. It validates usernames, securely stores credentials, and ensures only authorized users can access system resources. 
•	Password Hashing using Argon2/Bcrypt 
User passwords are never stored in plain text. Instead, modern cryptographic hashing algorithms like Argon2 or Bcrypt are used to convert passwords into secure, non-reversible hashes. This protects user data even if the credential storage file is compromised. 
•	Multi-Factor Authentication (OTP, TOTP, Hardware Token) 
To enhance security beyond passwords, the module supports multiple forms of MFA: 
•	One-Time Passwords (OTP) 
•	Time-based OTP (TOTP such as Google Authenticator) 
•	Hardware security tokens (e.g., FIDO2, U2F keys) 
This adds an extra layer of verification to prevent unauthorized access. 
•	Failed Login Attempt Detection 
The system tracks incorrect login attempts and applies security measures such as temporary lockouts or rate-limiting. This helps defend against brute-force attacks and credential stuffing. 
 
•	Secure Session Handling 
Once a user is authenticated, the module creates a secure session using encrypted session tokens. These sessions prevent hijacking attempts and ensure that user identity is preserved safely during system usage. 
•	Protection Against Memory Corruption 
The module includes protections against common low-level vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, unsafe memory operations, and trapdoor injections. Safe coding practices, bounds checking, and compiler-level security flags are used to safeguard the module. 
•	Real-Time Logging and Monitoring 
All authentication events—successful logins, failed attempts, MFA requests, and suspicious activities—are logged in real time. These logs assist system administrators in detecting anomalies, performing audits, and maintaining overall system security.

1. Project Overview 
This project focuses on developing a secure and reliable authentication module that integrates directly with modern operating systems. As cyber threats increase, traditional password-based authentication is no longer enough to protect sensitive system resources. To address this, the module introduces multifactor authentication (MFA) and strong security controls to ensure only authorized users can access the system. 
The authentication module enhances OS security by combining password verification, secure hashing, and one-time password (OTP/TOTP) based MFA. This layered approach significantly reduces risks from password leaks, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. The module also implements protection against common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, trapdoors, and unsafe memory operations by enforcing bounds checking, safe input handling, and compiler-level security features. 
To ensure compatibility and flexibility, the system integrates seamlessly with Linux environments through PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). This allows the module to work with existing login mechanisms, SSH authentication, sudo operations, and other system services without major modifications. 
In addition, the module includes a logging and monitoring component that records authentication events, failed login attempts, and suspicious activities. These logs help administrators detect abnormal behavior and strengthen overall system security.
